                <p>
                    Reticulate is an open source, secure, peer to peer file sharing system.
                    Once a file has been uploaded to the Reticulate network only the files owner (and anyone else the file has been shared with) can access their content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that no one can access your data without your express permission.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    To get started download the latest <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/RossRKK/reticulate/releases">release</a> from the GitHub page.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Extract the zip file</li>
                        <li>Run either "bin/peer.bat" (Windows) or "bin/peer" (Mac and Linux)</li>
                        <li>Enter a password for your Ethereum wallet (if you forget this there will be no way to recover your user account)</li>
                        <!--<li>Enter a username and password for the web client (this prevents unathorized code from affecting your account)</li>-->
                        <li>Transfer Ether to the address listed under "User Address" (ether is required in order to complete write operations). You can get Ether by using the <a target="_blank" href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby Faucet</a></li>
                        <li>You will then be able to register a username.</li>

                    It is possible to create many services that use the reticulate network.

                <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Encryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each retiulate user has an accociated Ethereum wallet (on the Rinkeby test net) and an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA key pair</a>.
                        When a file is uploaded a private key is generated that is used to encrypt the file, only someone with this key can access the file.
                        The user that created the file encrypts this key with their RSA public key and stores that encrypted key on an Ethereum smart contract.
                        Only that user can then decrypt the key later, in order to be able to access the file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If Alice wants to share a file with Bob she can get her copy of the encrypted key from the contract, decrypt it and then re-encrpyt it with Bob's public key and add a second version to the contract.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Transfer</h3>
                    <p>
                        With a conventional file storage system files are stored in a single centralised location that is vulnerable to attack.
                        On the Reticulate network files are stored by users of the network. Each Reticulate node stores some parts of some of the files on the network.
                        When someone wants to download a file they download different parts of it from different nodes.
